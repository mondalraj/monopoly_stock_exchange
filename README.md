  ![Game Dashboard](gameDashboard.png)
## About the GAME  
This is a basic java implementation program that mainly deals with oops concepts. Only 2 or 3 players can play the game at once for now. If you're familiar with Monopoly, this game is fairly similar. Instead of displaying countries or cities, it deals with real-life companies. In the game, players can buy companies and shares. Just like real shares, the value of shares will increase or decrease which will result in profit or loss for the players. The first player to cross $15k wins the game or gets bankrupted if his current balance is 0. We hope you have fun while playing the game. Please report any issues you find.
